# Quiz Code
In this  quiz code project, I have developed an apllication for taking timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
1. In the first page there are two buttons. the High Score record button will take you to check high score recored and the Start Quiz button will take you to the multiple choice questions.

2. Onece the start quiz button is clicked, the questions with clickable choices are displayed and if a choice is clicked a correct or wrong notification is desplayed and proced to the next question.
